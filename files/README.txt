=============
Introduction:
=============             

Meteor Swarm is a action game inspired by Asteroids as well as general retro game mechanics.  Blast your way through the swarm and try to rack up as many points as you can in any of the three game modes!

Meteor Swarm:
=============
Score points by destroying the meteors & try to clear the wave before the clock runs out.  Clearing out the wave with time remaining will earn you bonus points!  Fail to do so, and you'll have to deal with more Meteors on the next wave!

Survival:
=========
Score points by trying to avoid collisions with the Meteors & holding out until the clock ticks out.  Completing a level will increase your score multiplier (allowing you to earn more points), and colliding with a meteor will result in it being reset to 1x.

Classic:
========
Complete each level by clearing out the meteors.  Unlike the other modes, this mode doesn't have any time constraints.  So take your time, learn the controls and get to grips with how the game plays in this relaxed mode.

=============
